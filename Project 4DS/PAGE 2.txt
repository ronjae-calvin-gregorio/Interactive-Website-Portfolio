<p style="font-size:30px;font-family:consolas;text-align:left;color:Black;"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></p>
<p style="font-size:20px;font-family:Times New Roman;text-align:justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Department of Education (DepEd) offered five (5) kind of track for the students to choose.

 to basically make informed and particularly effective decisions about your career relevant to your goals and to mostly achieve them. Your career decision making journey is an on-going process of exploration, discovery and re-evaluation that will repeat itself throughout your lifetime. Not only are we faced with making decisions towards to our desire success 
 but we are accountable for the outcome and must actually take responsibility for the repercussions of our decisions.</p>

<p style="font-size:20px;font-family:Time New Roman;text-align:justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 4D'S offers a lot for grade 10 students who are unable to grasp the desire goal by strengthening their will on choosing strand and career.

<p style="font-size:20px;font-family:Time New Roman;text-align:justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not one day goes by where we do not have to make a decision. Making it effective to sound decisions is an art that learned through life experience. We used to make decision 
during our childhood although we do not always realize what will be the consequences when we really decide. Unlike now 
that we are in the stage or process of adolescence that we have to be decisive to our actions especially to our decisions in our life. As we grow older, the decisions become much more complex because it’s kind of align to how us to be successful in the future. Like in choosing  your strand or track there will be a factors that you have to consider that may mostly 
affect your decision making that will lead you to the directions towards to success. The first is personal, needs and wants which we are mostly concerned to the things that we have to satisfy during the situation. We must be able to know in what interests, which skills or capability us do we belong so that we can decide it for ourselves. It may help us to find 
out what’s the best for us when it comes to our life. Actually next is the family, the opinions of the members of the family matter the most or considered as vital in decision making especially of our parents before making a choice. In fact that our parents knows really the best for us and knows better when it comes to life therefore, their advice matters. 
The school and community have learned from our experiences and interaction with society and what kind of was taught to us through our formal education. We can generally say that we literally adapt to the standards set by our society and we see the impact of our decisions to ourselves. As a student we must also consider our school and community standard because 
it’s also help us to make our decisions right since we are still in the process. There is a tremendous amount of stress and anxiety that can mostly accompany making choices that affect his/her well-being, which is quite significant. Making and discussing the decisions about directions towards to our desire success essentially makes us fully fairly alive especially our heart and mind.</p>
