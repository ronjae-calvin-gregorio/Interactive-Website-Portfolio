<p style="font-size:20px;font-family:Time New Roman;text-align:justify;"</p><blockquote cite="http://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/k-12/">The K–12 program includes kindergarten and 12 years of basic education (kindergarten, six years of primary education, four years of junior high school, and two years of senior high school), giving students enough time to improve their learning skills and get ready for tertiary education (the college). Senior High School is a two-year program of specialized upper secondary education that allows students to select and choose a course of study based on their abilities, interests, and the school's capability. The subjects a student will take in grades G11 and G12 will depend on the professional track they choose. SHS courses fall into either the core curriculum of their choice or particular paths.</blockquote>
<p style="font-size:20px;font-family:Time New Roman;text-align:justify;"</p><blockquote cite="http://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/k-12/">In a book entitled, the Decision Making and Problem Solving Strategies written by John Adair, (1997), decision-making is all about deciding what action to take by a group or individuals; it usually involves a choice between two options. He also included that thinking should not be considered as a painful and laborious feeling in the mind because it is fun in a way that it trains the brain and it will be natural for a person to think always.</blockquote>
<p style="font-size:20px;font-family:Time New Roman;text-align:justify;"</p><blockquote cite="http://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/k-12/">In terms of decision making it includes past experiences, cognitive biases, an escalation of commitment, individual differences, including age and socioeconomic status, and a belief in personal relevance. People do not have the same intellect, attitude, and mind when it comes to making their own move. There are different people who experienced something in the past and wished to correct it by making the right decisions. There are also that has influenced the way they think because of certain individuals. They make their own decisions if they know that it will make them happy and satisfied.</blockquote>
<p style="font-size:20px;font-family:Time New Roman;text-align:justify;"</p><blockquote cite="www.universalclass.com">According to an article on the website www.universalclass.com, emotions have been a big part when it comes to decision making. It is stated that when emotions get the upper hand when it comes to decision making, the results could be good or devastated. The article also stated that emotions could be a big help. Before arriving on what decisions to make, one must learn how to recognize and name their feeling. The article suggested that a decision maker must know himself or herself first when making a big decision.</blockquote>
<p style="font-size:20px;font-family:Time New Roman;text-align:justify;"</p><blockquote cite="www.universalclass.com">Nobleza and Cleo Bernadette M. Valliente, (2016), academic experience is the most influencing factor in choosing senior high school academic track and recommendation of friends and family backgrounds have a moderate influence. Students have their own life. They are still normal people who are being affected by other people. The academic performance of people has the most influencing factor because it determines their ability to do work in the future. The students are just children who play at their playground, which is the whole world. According to the study entitled Factors Affecting High School Students’ Career Preference: A Basis for Career Planning Program by Dr. Nancy T. Pascual, (2014), the personality, ability, and intellect serves as the guide of students in choosing their career or course to take in college. He also added that experiencing the career suited for the students could be a big help in the future of the students. To be able to do or experience the career sooner that a student would like to take in college is already a big advantage. It gives them the overview of what would like to be an engineer or doctor. The K-12 program could really help the students when it comes to harnessing the abilities of students.</blockquote>
<p style="font-size:20px;font-family:Time New Roman;text-align:justify;"</p><blockquote cite="www.universalclass.com">On Witko’s studies on senior high school students' occupational aspirations (2006), he found out that interests, skill, personal meaning, challenges and parental support are variables contributory to the occupational aspirations of senior high school students. Because of the support of the other people students tend to inspire in school and study hared. In like manner with the study of La (2009) on factors influencing the educational and career choices of senior high school students revealed that parent’ supports, school structure, gender and grade point average have considerable influence on the Vietnamese Senior high school students’ educational and career choice. Parents support their child choosing the career in Senior High School.</blockquote>
