<p style="font-size:20px;font-family:Times New Roman;text-align:justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This project proposal is difficult to create or work on. It takes a lot of time to be done; making it requires taking also a lot of things into account. We gave the issue occurring that our school 
encounter every year while considering what will be our title in this project; but we struggle to create or come up with one. There’s a lot of issue or problem to every students or even in our environment. 
The one is suffering in mental health; in their public speaking, readings, there’s also having a problem with their skills in other subjects like Mathematics, Science or even in English. Either in trash, 
we have a problem with that. We also have known that every student make their decision about what they want to pursue in life especially when they are in Grade 10 level. And the one we chose to create a 
title is about Decision-Making. Why? In our observations there’s a lot of student are not ready to make a decision that connecting with their dreams. They didn’t know what and where path do they belong; 
they can’t decide because it’s difficult for them to create or make one.  So our group will admit that it’s not easy to decide and we will not a professional to teach this project, but we are here to make 
our best to make it easier with you and make a progression about what’s life brings us and to be the best version or ourselves in the near future. We are here to help the incoming seniors to get ready in 
what decisions they’ll make.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem to be resolved is not easy to distinguish. Our empowerment technology 
teacher asks us to think at least ten (10) titles each for our project proposal and it might difficult. First ten titles didn’t approved but we think again.   We asked ourselves, “Why not this project 
considers our decisions and direction towards to our success? Why not give it a try to be our title in this project?” So, we tried and tried; make a new one that suitable for our thoughts in decision 
making until it fully approved by our teacher. We come up with the title “PROJECT 4DS: Discussing Decision, Directions and Desires to Succeed”. We assigned every members of our group the task that they 
going to do that day. The one is assigned in Introduction; the other is assigned in rationale, review of related literature, the needs and the cost, expected outcome (flyers), objectives and for documentation. 
All members have given their tasks to do, making a research, and reading some details or example of a project proposal to gain some ideas of its context.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And for the project we’ve working on, we’re starting it by browsing and outlining our aims 
and what ideas are coming in our minds when we hear the word decision and succeed. We discuss the ideas of how will we introduce our project in a nice and brilliant way to easy understand of our target audience. 
Until we came up with the plan for how this project be completed. After discussing and collecting every idea, we’ve starting to do the introduction. During the process of our proposal, we realize those important 
of making a decision. Based on our studies and interview some of the junior high school especially our target audience which is the grade 10 students are having a struggle about what strand they will choose in 
senior high. But some of them are already decided of their future career. They had their own thoughts of the path they choose. That’s why we choose this project because we know that everyone makes a progress by 
making and deciding for our own. By trusting the process and make it desirable to each and everyone.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We start our introduction last December 14 and we created a 1 paragraph. Then we continued 
it during the Christmas break but the Christmas break affect the on-going project proposal, some of the factors are poor internet connection and loss of interaction of the group mates. Although we create a group 
chat in messenger where we can easy access or communicate to each other for this project even the others are not online. We still choose to continue the project but this time the active members only are the one 
who is talking to each other because some of the members are not having a connection. It is not allowed to do a meet up that’s why it’s difficult for us to do it. We think of another way to do this; we suggest 
and asked ourselves that “what if we do a Google meet which each of us will join and help each other to think of what’s really the best for each part?” so, we decided to make a link immediately and join who 
has the internet connection for the fastest communication. Others are struggling so they can ask and chat to group chat, everyone worked together to create this project proposal. In making this project, we 
always put in our minds that this project is for those students who are having a difficulty for choosing the best path in their future. That this project has a purpose in our high school life; it’s a big 
help to them to make it easier in choosing and making a decision and direction towards to their success. Making this proposal was difficult for us for being a first timer; but in everyone’s cooperation we 
ended up it very well. Everyone take their parts seriously even though we’re communicating through online. In everyone’s cooperation in this project we survived it and did our best for this. As a group 
and for this project proposal it’s help us to enhance our skills in every aspect as a part of being a senior high school students.
